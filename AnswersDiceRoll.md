**Question 1:** The probability of rolling a 7 is 6 divided by 36 because 6 is 
the number of rolls that summed together get 7 and 36 is the total number of possible
rolls with two die. So the probability of rolling a 7 is 1/6. 
The probability of rolling a 2 is 1 divided by 36 because there is only one way to get a
sum of 2 when rolling two die. This means that the probability of rolling a 2 is 1/36. 

**Question 2:** The more rolls the greater the look at the probability for each given 
roll.For 100 this would be a moderate look at what it would be but the more rolls the 
better the look at probability for reach value rolled from 2-12. For 100 rolls in this 
simulation the probability of each values for 5 run throughs were: Trail 1 2:1:0.01,
3:5:0.05, 4:10:0.1, 5:14:0.14, 6:14:0.14 ,7:17:0.17, 8:9:0.09, 9:10:0.1, 10:11:0.11, 
11:7:0.07, 12:2:0.02. 

Trail 2: 2:2:0.02,3:5:0.05,4:5:0.05,5:11:0.11, 6:12:0.12, 7:15:0.15, 8:15:0.15,9:12:0.12,
10:13:0.13, 11:6:0.06, 12:4:0.04.

Trail 3: 2:4:0.04,3:4:0.04,4:13:0.13,5:11:0.11,6:18:0.18,7:12:0.12,8:13:0.13,9:9:0.09,
10:8:0.08,11:6:0.06,12:2:0.02.

Trail 4: 2:2:0.02,3:8:0.08,4:10:0.1,5:15:0.15,6:13:0.13,7:16:0.16,8:12:0.12,9:11:0.11,
10:7:0.07,11:6:0.06,12:0:0.0.

Trail 5: 2:6:0.06,3:7:0.07,4:7:0.07,5:10:0.1,6:8:0.08,7:19:0.19,8:15:0.15,9:12:0.12,
10:7:0.07,11:8:0.08,12:1:0.01.

As you can see by the 5 run throughs, there is still a fair amount of variation. 

**Question 3:**

Trail 1: 2:150:0.03,3:283:0.0566,4:400:0.08,5:592:0.1184,6:685:0.137,7:850:0.17,
8:682:0.1364,9:545:0.109,10:416:0.0832,11:268:0.0536,12:129:0.0258.

Trail 2: 2:146:0.0292,3:298:0.0596,4:411:0.0822,5:535:0.107,6:691:0.1382,7:855:0.171,
8:662:0.1324,9:565:0.113,10:409:0.0818,11:280:0.056,12:148:0.0296.

Trail 3: 2:128:0.0256,3:291:0.0582,4:402:0.0804,5:549:0.1098,6:700:0.14,7:812:0.1624,
8:727:0.1454,9:555:0.111,10:407:0.0814,11:291:0.0582,12:138:0.0276.

Trail 4: 2:142:0.0284,3:316:0.0632,4:458:0.0916,5:555:0.111,6:645:0.129,7:810:0.162,
8:679:0.1358,9:511:0.1022,10:442:0.0884,11:282:0.0564,12:160:0.032.

Trail 5: 2:150:0.03,3:259:0.0518,4:408:0.0816,5:529:0.1058,6:683:0.1366,7:872:0.1744,

Running more simulations gives a much more accurate view of what the probability for 
each value is. The more trials the greater the probability.  

**Question 4:** 
7:24 number of times 7 was rolled
7:20 "   "
7:12 "   "
7:15 "   " 
7:15 "   "

(24+20+12+15+15) / 5 = 17.6% 

2:6 number of times 2 was rolled
2:0 "    "
2:6 "    "
2:6 "    "
2:3 "    "

(6+0+6+6+3) / 5 = 4.2%
