**Question #1:** The probability of rolling a certain number is the number of possible rolls that can sum to that number divided by the total number of possible rolls. What is the probability of rolling a 7? What is the probability of rolling a 2?
	Roll a 7 = 6/36 = 1/6
	Roll a 2 = 1/36

**Question 2:** Comment on the variation of values among the simulation runs. Is 100 rolls sufficient to determine the relative frequency of all the possible rolls?
	Most of the rolls tend to fall between 5 and 9. I would say no, 100 rolls is not enough rolls because there are a lot of possible rolls and in order to properly determine the relative frequency it would be better to have more rolls.
	
**Question 3:** How did increasing the number of simulations affect the results?
	Obviously, the numbers increased, allowing you to see the difference in the rolls better. For instance, on one set, 2 was only rolled 132 times, while 7 was rolled 823 times. The numbers also tended to be more accurate, as they didn't fluctuate as much.

**Question 4:** How many rolls per simulation does it take before you can accurately predict the probability of rolling a 7 to 3 significant digits five times in a row? How about for the probability of rolling a 2?
	I would say it takes around 100,000,000 rolls to predict accurately to 3 digits. You can get away with less than that (probably around 1,000,000) if you are only concerned with the first two digits, though.
