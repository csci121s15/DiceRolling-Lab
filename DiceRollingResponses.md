**Question 1:** The probability of rolling a 7 is 1/6, and the probability of rolling a 2 is 1/36.

**Question 2:** 100 rolls are efficient enough to determine the relative frequency of the posssible results because it has a large variety of numbers in order to collect data from.

**Question 3:** Increasing the results decreases the frequency barely, but the frequency generally remains the same.

**Question 4:** It takes a very long time to roll a 7 and get at least 0.166. It takes at least 100 times to get it, and then it takes longer for 2, due to its ratio being so much smaller.
