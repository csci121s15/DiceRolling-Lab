### Question 1:
The probability of rolling a 7 would be probably a 17%. The probability of rolling a 2 would be around 5%.

###Question 2:
While running the simulation 100 times, the values (getUpValues) are between the values 2- 19. I think that running the simulation 100 is sufficient to determine the frequency. It's better than using 50 runs. But, we could have also done 1000 simulation runs which would be better. 

###Question 3:
By increasing the number of simulations, the getUpValue increases while the percentage/probability decreases. 

###Question 4:
I did 1,000,000 simulation runs. The probability of rolling a 7 would be 0.167122 and probability of rolling a 2 would be 0.027829.
