**Question 1:** The probability of rolling a certain number is the number of possible rolls that can sum to that number divided by the total number of possible rolls. What is the probability of rolling a 7? What is the probability of rolling a 2?

	The probability of rolling a 7 is .16

	The probability of rolling a 2 is .02

**Question 2:** Comment on the variation of values among the simulation runs. Is 100 rolls sufficient to determine the relative frequency of all the possible rolls?

	I think that it will not be a sufficient amount of rolls to determine accurate frequency.

**Question 3:** How did increasing the number of simulations affect the results?

	The frequency of the ratio was smaller that was I predicted.

**Question 4:** How many rolls per simulation does it take before you can accurately predict the probability of rolling a 7 to 3 significant digits five times in a row? How about for the probability of rolling a 2?

	The amount of rolls per simulation it took to accurately predict the probablility of rolling a 7 is about 1,000 rolls. To roll a 2, it's about 5,000 rolls to consectively get the probability prediction.
