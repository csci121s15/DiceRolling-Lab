**Question 1 :** There is a 1/6 chance of rolling a 7, and a 1/36 chance of rolling a 2. 

**Question 2:** Once 100 rolls were rolled, I believe that 100 rolls is not sufficient enough to determine the relative frequency of all the possible rolls becuase though 100 is a large number, it does not give an accuracte frequency for all of the posssible rolls. 

**Question 3:** By increasing the number to 500, there is more of a chance for the coder to see if they can accuratley predict the chances of rolling their die. 

**Question 4:** It would take approximately 400,000 rolls before we can predict the porbablity of rolling a 7 or a 3. For finding the proabality of a 2, that would take 200,000 rolls.
