#Question 1:

**The probability of rolling a 7 is 16% and the probability of rolling a 2 is 5%**


#Question 2:

** While running the simulation many times, the results demonstrated random values and it seem to always fall the number between 5 and 9. In addition, according to my observation, 100 rolls wouldn't be sufficient because the values would change and it would be so random. In conclusion, 100 rolls wouldnt be enough to determine the relative.**

#Question 3:

** Incresing the number of simulations did increase into a precise resuls. The numbers became more accurate and didn't give us a random results**

#Question 4:

** I believe it would take 1,000,000 to 5,000,000 rolls per simulation to predict a precise results of finding the probabilility of rolling a 7 to 3. In addition, I perform the simulation 30,000 times by rolling a 2 and I got a results of 0.027 consistenly.
