**Question 1:** The probability of rolling a 7 is `1/6`. The probability of rolling a 2 is `1/36`.

**Question 2:** After running the program for 100 rolls, I determined that 100 rolls is not sufficient. This is because for each time I ran it, the relative frequency for each possible roll wasn't exactly what it was the previous time. The frequencies were inconsistent each time.

**Question 3:** Increasing the number of rolls simulations affected the results by making them more precise. As the rolls increased, the frequency was closer to the previous simulation ran. 

**Question 4:** It took about 40,000 or more rolls per simulation before I could accurately predict the probability of rolling a 7 to 3 significant digits. For rolling a probability of 2 it took over 150,000 rolls per simulation.
