##Dice Rolling Lab

**Question 1:** The probability of rolling a 7 is 0.166, etc. The probability of rolling a 2 is 0.027, etc.


**Question 2:** It seems like there is a fair amount of variation in the numbers, although it is clear that the indices closer to the middle of the array are getting more tally marks than those on either end. It does not seem like 100 rolls is sufficient to determine the relative frequency of all possible rolls. 

**Question 3:** It seems that the ratios are much more consistent across multiple tests.

**Question 4:** Unless I am mistaken it takes around 1000000 rolls per simulation to accurately predict the probability of both of these numbers
