#Dice Rolling Lab
**Question 1:**
The probability of rolling a 7 is 3/36 or 1/12. The probability of rolling a 2 id 1/36.
**Question 2**
The first simulation I got these results:
2: 3: 0.03, 3: 4: 0.04, 4: 10: 0.1, 5: 13: 0.13, 6: 14: 0.14, 7: 19: 0.19, 8: 13: 0.13, 
9: 11: 0.11, 10: 8: 0.08, 11: 3: 0.03, 12: 2: 0.02
In the second simulation I got these results:
2: 7: 0.07, 3: 5: 0.0, 4: 4: 0.04, 5: 4: 0.04, 6: 16: 0.16, 7: 18: 0.18, 8: 19: 0.19,
9: 10: 0.1, 10: 8: 0.08, 11: 7: 0.07, 12: 2: 0.02
In the third simulation I got these results:
2: 1: 0.01, 3: 6: 0.06, 4: 11: 0.11, 5: 9: 0.09, 6: 18: 0.18, 7: 13: 0.13, 8: 9: 0.09
9: 11: 0.11, 10: 13: 0.13, 11: 7: 0.07, 12: 2: 0.02
In the fourth simulation I got these results:
2: 3: 0.03, 3: 6: 0.06, 4: 5: 0.05, 5: 7: 0.07, 6: 18: 0.18, 7: 19: 0.19, 8: 11: 0.11
9: 13: 0.13, 10: 9: 0.09, 11: 5: 0.05, 12: 4: 0.04
In the fifth simulation I got these results:
2: 7: 0.07, 3: 10: 0.1, 4: 7: 0.07, 5: 14: 0.14, 6: 16: 0.16, 7: 18: 0.18, 8: 14: 0.14
9: 6: 0.06, 10: 4: 0.04, 11: 4: 0.04, 12: 0: 0.0
I believe that 100 rolls is sufficient enough to determine all the possible rolls. 
**Question 3**
The increasing the number of stimulation allows for a much more accurate view of what the 
probability for each value wil be. The more trials that are ran the more precise 
 probability.
 **Question 4**
 The probability of rolling a 7 five times in a row is 17.6%. The probability of rolling a 
 2 five times in a row id 4.2%.
