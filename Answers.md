# Dice Rolling Lab Answers
### *Martin Nesbitt* 

######Question #1
There is a 1/6 chance of rolling a 7 and a 1/36 chance of rolling a 2.

######Question #2
Yes, 100 rolls seems to provide the right amount of clarity because it is a nice even, big number that is easily measureable. 

######Question #3
By increasing the number of rolls, the user is able to see a more accurate set of ratios among the possible values therefore providing more insight into the measurements. 

######Question #4
It took 50,000 rolls to get 3 significant digits from 7. However for 2, it took 50,000,000 rolls to get 3 signifcant figures 5 times in a row. This is because the probability of rolling a 7 is much bigger than rolling a 2 so therefore it takes less rolls for 7 rather than 2.
