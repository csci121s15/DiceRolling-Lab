>**Question 1:** The probability of rolling a certain number is the number of possbile rolls that can sum to that number divided by the total number of possible rolls. What is the probability of rolling a 7? What is the probability of rolling a 2?

**Answer 1:** The probability of rolling a 7 is a 1/6 chance.  The chance of rolling a 2 is a 1/18 chance. 

>**Question 2:** Comment on the variation of values among the simulation runs.  Is 100 rolls sufficient to determine the relative frequency of all the possible rolls?

**Answer 2:** Everytime we ran our simulation the numbers changed because it was at random.  Since it was random I didn't see any consistency.  Therefore, I don't believe 100 rolls is sufficient to determine the relative frequency of all the rolls.

>**Quesiton 3:** How did increasing the number of simulations affect the results?

**Answer 3:** Increasing the number of simulations gives us more sufficient results.  The results were much close to being consistent for example, for 2 the range was anywhere from .24 to .34 in the ratio which is pretty close. 

>**Question 4:**  How many rolls per simulation does it take before you can accuarately predict the probability of rolling 7 to 3 significant digits five times in a row? How about for the probability of rolling a 2?

**Answer 4:** The amount of rolls per simulation it takes to accurately predict the probablility of rolling a 7 is about 1000 rolls to get if five times in a row.  To roll a 2, its about 5000 rolls to get it five times in a row.
