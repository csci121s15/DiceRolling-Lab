**Question 1:** The probability of rolling a certain number is the number of possible rolls that can sum to that number divided by the total number of possible rolls. What is the probability of rolling a 7? What is the probability of rolling a 2?

**Answer**: Due to there being 36 possible roles, the probibility for 7 is 6/36 or 1/6, for 2 it is 1/36.

**Question 2:** Comment on the variation of values among the simulation runs. Is 100 rolls sufficient to determine the relative frequency of all the possible rolls?

100 roles is not sufficient to determine the relative frequency, because if you run the code mutliple times you see that the numbers you are getting are not consistent.

**Question 3:** How did increasing the number of simulations affect the results?

When the amount of simulations is increased to a number like 1000 there is more consistency in the data everytime it is run, with the numbers 5-8 consistently appearing over 100 times and with 7 appearing the most.

**Question 4:** How many rolls per simulation does it take before you can accurately predict the probability of rolling a 7 to 3 significant digits five times in a row? How about for the probability of rolling a 2?

With 1,000,000 rolls, a 7 consistently shows up a 0.166 percent of the time, also with this many rolls 2 consistnetly shows up 0.027 percent of the time.
