**Question 1:**  The probability of rolling a certain number is the number of possible rolls that can sum to that number divded by the total number of possible rolls.  What is the probability of rolling a 7?  What is the probability of rolling a 2?

**Answer 1:** The probability of rolling a 7 would be 1/6 chance because there are 36 outcomes total and 6 out of those 36 could possibly be a total of 7.  The probability of rolling a2 would be 1/18 chance. 

**Question 2:** Comment on the variation of values among the simulation runs.  Is 100 rolls sufficient to determine the relative frequency of all the possible rolls?

**Answer 2:** Each time the simulation was ran the values changed because it is always going to be a random number. For example the value of 2 in the first simulation was that 2 was rolled 0.01 times but after the fifth simulation 2 was rolled 0.05 times.  I don't think 100 is sufficient to determine the relative frequency of all the possible rolls because the results were so random.  I think the number of rolls need to be higher.  

**Question 3:** How did increasing the number of simulations affect the results?

**Answer 3:** By increasing the number of simulations, the results were closer to being consistent.  Which means that after running the simulation 5 times, the values were closer together, where as, when we ran it 100 times the values were a lot more random. 

**Question 4:** How many rolls per simulation does it take before you can accurately predict the probability of rolling a 7 to 3 significant digits five times in a row? How about for the probability of rolling a 2?

**Answer 4:** The amount of rolls it takes to accurately predict the probability of rolling a 7 to 3 would be about 1000 because after running the simulation 5 times the values were extremely consistant for 7.  The amount of rolls it takes to accurately predict for 2 would be about 5000 because there is a less chance of rolling a sum of 2 then there is a 7 so it will take more rolls in the simulation.
