**Question 1**

The probability of rolling a 7 is 1/6.
The probability of rolling a 2 is 1/36.

**Question 2**

When running the Monte Carlo simulation with 100 rolls you get a skew in the frequency. For example, in one test ofmy simulation, the probability for rolling a 7 was 13%, however, mathematically it should have been around 17%. Also, when you run the same simulation 5 different times. The percentages you get for each roll of the dice are variable.

**Question 3**

When you run the Monte Carlo simulation with 5000 rolls the data are much more consistent with the mathematical probability and shows less variability when run against itself.

**Question 4**

Running the simulation 100,000 you get an accurate percentage around 16-17%. By running it 1,000,000 you can be fairly certain that you will get the result of 16.6%.
