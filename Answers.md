1. The probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36, or 1/6. The probability of rolling a 2 is 1/36.
2. Most of the time a pattern will appear (the outcomes of 5, 6, 7, 8 will be rolled more often than, say 2, 3, 11, 12). However, occasionally, there will be a rogue outcome that will be rolled more than it would have been predicted to be rolled. 100 rolls is okay, but to get better results, rolling more than 100 would be preferable.
3. By increasing the number of simulations, the roll outcomes become more similar to those we predicted using probability.
4. I may have done it wrong, but I had to get up to 250,000 rolls before I could get .166 for rolling a 7 five times in a row. I also was able to match the probability of rolling a 2 at this point as well.
