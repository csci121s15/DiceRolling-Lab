# Dice Rolling Lab Answers
### John Vonelli

*Question 1*:  
The probability of rolling a 7 is 1/6.  The probability of rolling a 2 is 1/36.

*Question 2*:  
I notice that the higher tallies usually fall in the single digit numbers that are greater than 5.  The 100 roles is  sufficent because it does show all possible roles but on a smaller scale.  The 100 roles does allow the user to clearly see the relationship between the other die roles much easier than lower role counts.

*Question 3*:  
Increasing the number of simulations did not affect the results that much because the majority of the highest amount of tallies still lies  between 5 and 9.

*Question 4*:  
It took 50,000 roles to get 3 significant digits for 7, and it took close to 50,000,000 rolls to get 3 significant digits for 2.  Since it took less roles for the die to fall on the 7, it took much longer for the 2 to get the 3 significant digits than the 7.
