1. Probability of rolling a seven is 1 / 6.  Probability of rolling a 2 is 1 / 36.

2. The bulk of the values is around the middle numbers such as 5 through 9.  100 rolls is not efficient to determine the frequency.

3. The highest frequency of values are still 5 through 9 but they seem to overall be closer.

4. At 500,000 rolls you can accurately predict the probability of rolling a 7 to 3 significant digits.  At 300,00 rolls you can accurately predict the probability of rolling a 2 to 3 significant digits.
