# Dice Rolling Lab answers

**Question 1:**
There are 6 combinations of 2 dice that equal 7 and 36 combinations of all possible rolls. That means that there is a probability of 6/36 or 1/6 of rolling a combination that adds up to 7. Likewise, there is a 1/36 probability of rolling a 2.

**Question 2:**
There is often a variation between frequencies after each simulation of rolls. Rolling 100 times is not sufficient to determine realistic ratios.

**Question 3:**
Increasing the number of rolls gave frequency ratios that were more consistent for each simulation.

**Question 4:**
It took 5,000,000 rolls per simulation to accurately predict the probability of getting a 7 to 3 significant digits which resulted as 0.166. For rolling a 2, it took 30,0000 rolls per simulation to get the probability of 0.027 consistently. Those are the same values as 1/6 and 1/36 to 3 significant digits.
