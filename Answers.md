#Dice-Rolling Lab Answers
####Question 1:
Total possible rolls: 6*6  

Rolling a 7: 6/36 (1/6)   
Rolling a 2: 1/36


####Question 2:
Running the simulation 5 times shows that the overall variation between values is immense, thus, 100 rolls is NOT sufficient to determine the relative frequenc of all the possible rolls.

####Question 3:
Increasing the number of rolls greatly increases the precision of the simulation, as expected.
