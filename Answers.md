**Question 1:** The probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36, or 0.167 while the probability of getting a 2 is 1/36 or 0.028.

**Question 2:** When running the program 5 times with 100 rolls, there was a very large variation between the different trials. There were times when being further away from seven gave a higher ratio, which shouldn't happen, and rolling a seven gave a ratio higher than .167 for four out of the five trials. All in all, using 100 rolls is not sufficient to give the relative frequency of all the possible rolls.

**Question 3:** Increasing the number of rolls per histogram made the answers much closer to the predicted probabilities, however there was still some signs of minute variation among trials. This would disappear if the number of rolls kept increasing though. Another affect of increasing the rolls per trial is that the histogram was much more uniform and semetrical, forming almost a bell curve arrangement where being higher or lower than seven by the same magnitude gave relatively the same probability of occuring.

**Question 4:** When I repeated the experiment increasing the number of rolls each time, I found that I could reach the expected probability for 2 5 times in a row in as early as 30,000 rolls. However, It took a longer time to get to the expected probability of 7, which took as high as 200,000. There is some degree of luck involved with this however, and both of these numbers might be earlier or later than the answer's I've given.
